# Bayesian Linear Model (`blm`)

The blm library contains tools to run Bayesian linear regression models in R. Some of its key features are:

- Lazy evaluation of linear model objects
- Automatic generation of starting values
- Automatically center continuous variables
- Model fit (DIC)
- Posterior predictive checks for linear regression assumptions
- Sampling history, autocorrelation, and density plots
- Core functions are fast thanks to Julia code
